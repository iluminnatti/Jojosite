# Jojosite

*Jojosite* is a simple website HTML and CSS based I made in 2019, when I was on the 1st grade of the highschool as a homework. I do love Jojo's, and so I decided to dedicate an **entire website** for it rsrsrsrsrss

You can access the result by clicking [here](https://iluminnatti.github.io/Jojosite)



Once I was leraning the pillars of web designing when I made this project, it is not so ***"complex and perfectly developed"*** (it is not even responsible), but I wanted to keep this with me to remind me how everythng starded for me on the *Dev's World*.
